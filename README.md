# K-NearestNeighbor
Rough Implementation for 1st-Nearest Neighbor (K-Nearest Neighbor) Classification in Python. Program converts a stemmed document collection to Bag-of-Words: Vector Space Model, then performs 1-NN Classification. Results then produce evaluation of classifier and report accuracy.
Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation used to evaluate classifier and accuracy. Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance as comparative vector metrics.
